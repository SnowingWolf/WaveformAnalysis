Contract Tests for WaveformAnalysis

This package contains contract tests that verify:
1. Plugin contracts - All builtin plugins have valid specs
2. Cache consistency - Cache hit/miss behavior is correct
3. Compatibility - Alias and deprecation handling works correctly
4. Golden path - Standard data flow works end-to-end

These tests serve as regression gates to catch contract violations early.
